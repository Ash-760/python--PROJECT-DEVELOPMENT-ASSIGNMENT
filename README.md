# ðŸ“Š COVID-19 Global Data Tracker

This project is a Python-based data analysis and visualization tool that tracks global COVID-19 trends over time. It uses real-world data to analyze and visualize metrics such as total cases, deaths, and vaccination progress across selected countries.

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Objectives

- Import and clean global COVID-19 data from Our World in Data
- Analyze time trends including cases, deaths, and vaccinations
- Compare COVID-19 metrics across Kenya, USA, and India
- Visualize trends using charts and interactive maps
- Generate insights and communicate findings clearly

## ðŸ›  Tools & Libraries Used

- Python 3.x
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- plotly.express

## ðŸš€ How to Run the Project

1. **Clone or download this project folder**
2. **Download the dataset** from: [OWID COVID-19 Data](https://covid.ourworldindata.org/data/owid-covid-data.csv)
3. Save the CSV file in the same directory as the script.
4. **Install required libraries** using pip:

    ```bash
    pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn plotly
    ```

5. **Run the script** in your terminal or VS Code:

    ```bash
    python covid_tracker.py
    ```

6. **Or use Jupyter Notebook** for an interactive version:

    - Open `covid_tracker.ipynb` in VS Code or Jupyter
    - Run each cell sequentially

## ðŸ’¡ Insights & Reflections

- **India** had the steepest increase in total cases, with significant spikes.
- **USA** led with early and consistent vaccine rollouts.
- **Kenya** maintained relatively lower case numbers but had slower vaccine distribution.
- Death rates fluctuated especially in the early stages due to unreported or late-reported data.
- The use of interactive choropleth maps gives a powerful geographic overview of the pandemic.
